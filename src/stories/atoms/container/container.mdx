# Container

## A modern approach to containers, using CSS grid. 

Containers help constrain the content to a certain maximum width, while centering the content. 
In the past we used `max-width` and `margin` for this, but these days a more modern approach is using CSS grid for this.

The concept remains the same, you wrap your HTML elements with a `.container` class.
The CSS on the other hand, makes use of named grid lines and some clever grid columns.

## Usage

Currently the container supports the following children: 
- `.full` (full-width content), 
- `.breakout` (breakout content)
- default centered content

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="full">
        This is fullwidth content
    </div>

    <div>
        This is normal container content.
    </div>

    <div class="breakout">
        This is breakout content
    </div>
</div>
```

## Customizing
You can change some CSS variables for customizing your containers.

```css
--container-gap: clamp(var(--spacing-4), 6vw, var(--spacing-8));
--container-max-width: minmax(var(--container-gap), 1fr);
--content-max-width: min(120ch, 100% - var(--container-gap) * 2);
--breakout: minmax(0, var(--spacing-9));
```

Currently the content is limited to `120ch`. You could use a `px` value here if your prefer this more.
Feel free to change the spacing variables to your liking as well.
