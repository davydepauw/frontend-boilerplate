# Grid

Grid uses CSS grid for creating customizable layouts based on the requirements of your project. 
All CSS is completely up to you to decide. The main purpose is to create an easy to use, flexible system to build custom CSS upon.

## Usage

To make use of the grid, simply add the `.grid` classname. Via modifier classes, you can specify which grid you want. 

Standard these classes are provided, but these can be adjusted to suit your specific needs.

- `.grid--2` (an equal two-column grid)
- `.grid--3` (an equal three-column grid)
- `.grid--fluid` (an equal column fluid grid, based on character width limit)

So a three column grid can be created via:


```html
<div class="grid grid--3">
    ...
</div>
```

## Custom layouts

If you want to create custom grids, the suggestion is to use generic names for it. Identify the types of grids you need for your project, and choose sensible re-usable names for it.
For example, if you have a content page (with sidebar), support page (sidebar + CTA column), and product browser (with filters in side column), you could provide these classes:

```css
.grid--content {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 4fr;
}

.grid--support {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
}

.grid--browser {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr;
}

```

## Nesting

Grids can off course be nested, as the [Product Browser](../?path=/story/atoms-grid--browser) example shows:

```jsx
<div className="grid grid--browser">
    <Card
        title="Product filters"
    />

    <div className="grid grid--3">
        <CardProduct
            title="Product A"
        />

        <CardProduct
            title="Product B"
        />

        <CardProduct
            title="Product C"
        />

        <CardProduct
            title="Product D"
        />

        <CardProduct
            title="Product E"
        />
    </div>

    </div>
</div>
```
